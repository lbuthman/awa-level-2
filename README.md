## To the Highest Peaks

Going from Level 1 Apex to Level 2 Apex is much easier than the expedition from Level 0 to Level 1. This org represents
a preliminary state of an org with an Enterprise Level trigger framework, specifically the Trigger Actions framework. 
This can be considered an early state of a Level 2 org, ready for greater enhancements and upgrades.
